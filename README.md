## Bundle & Save - Front End Development Task

# Overview
This repository contains the code for the "Bundle & Save" front-end development task. The task is designed to assess your ability to transform a UI design into a functional prototype with pixel-perfect accuracy. The provided example video demonstrates the desired functionality, while the Figma design link shows the expected visual layout.

# Project Description
The project involves creating an interactive UI that allows users to select different bundle options with dynamic details expansion upon clicking. The design consists of three interactive boxes that expand to display size and color options when clicked.

# Features
Pixel-Perfect Design: The implementation closely follows the Figma design specifications.
Interactive Elements: Users can select different bundles, with dynamic details expansion and visual feedback.
Responsive Design: The layout adapts to various screen sizes while maintaining the design integrity.
Vanilla JavaScript: All interactive elements are implemented using plain JavaScript.

# Files
index.html: The HTML structure of the webpage.
